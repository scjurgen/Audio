/*
PHASER effect
  The Phaser used an Allpass biquad filter that will change
  the phase depending on the centerfrequency.  
  The order of the filter determines the strength.
  The center frequency is continuesly shifted.

  THis example does not use regen, which means to feedback 
  the shifted signal to the entrance (with a second mixed).
 
  Best use this effect with chords and pads.
