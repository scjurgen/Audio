PHASER effect
  The Phaser uses an allpass filter that will change
  the phase of the signal depending on the center frequency and q-factor.

  The number of stages determines the strength. Typically are 4 8 12 stage phasers
  The center frequency is continuesly shifted.

  THis example does not use have a "regen", which feeds the processed signal back
  to the entrance (with a second mixed).
 
  Best use this effect with chords and pads.
